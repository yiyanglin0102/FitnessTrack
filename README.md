FitnessTrack is a health record listing Android application, allows users to record food items in each meal and define the health level of each meal. Our motivation for this App was when we workout, we want to have an app to record our food for each meal. Since there are several workout foods information that we would like to record all at once, we can use this app to record the date and healthy level about the food ingredients. In short, we made this app to manage our diet in terms of our personal workout exercise.
