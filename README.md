FitnessTrack is a health record-keeping Android application that allows users to record the food items they eat at each meal and assign a health rating to each one. We were motivated to create this app because we wanted a convenient way to track our food intake alongside our workouts. With FitnessTrack, we can easily record all of the nutritional information for our meals in one place, including the date and healthiness rating of each ingredient. In short, we created this app to help us manage our diet in conjunction with our personal workout routines.
